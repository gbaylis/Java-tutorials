/*
The While loop / Java / Oct 10 2019
gbaylis
this code uses the while loop to print a sentence and the # of cups of coffee
I set the while loop to start at 0, increment by + 1 and stop at 4 (or < 5)

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    // start counting at 0    
        int cups = 0;
        
        // code will stop running when # of cups is = to 4
        while(cups < 5)
        {
    // print a sentence and then the # of cups        
            System.out.println(" cups of coffee this week " + cups);
            
            // the # of cups increases by 1, each time the while loop runs
            cups = cups + 1;
